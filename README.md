# ESP-relay-8ch

ESP32 based board with 8x 24 VDC inputs and 8x 10A relay outputs.

This board is designed to be driven by an Olimex ESP32-POE or ESP32-POE-ISO modules running Tasmota.

The design considers that the board will be mounted on a PCB DIN rail holder. The dimensions consider the holders offered by the Brazilian manufacturer Metaltex, check [here](https://www.metaltex.com.br/produtos/componentes/suportes/sp7-suporte-para-montagem-de-placa-de-circuito-impresso-em-trilho-din) for details.
